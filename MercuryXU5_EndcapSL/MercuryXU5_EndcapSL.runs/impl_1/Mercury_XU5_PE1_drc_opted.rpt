2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
MIG-69#1 Warning
Invalid Constraint  
[Mercury_XU5_i/ddr4] The Memory IP reset port %ELG has an incompatible IO Standard LVCMOS18 selected. If a level shifter or similar is used to ensure compatibility, this DRC can be demoted. For more details please refer AR66800.
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-58#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a global clock-capable IO pin and BUFG pair.
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The global clock-capable IO (GCIO) is placed on a GCIO capable site (b) The BUFG is placed in the same bank of the device as the GCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	ETH1_RXCLK_IBUF_inst/IBUFCTRL_INST (in ETH1_RXCLK_IBUF_inst macro) (IBUFCTRL.O) is locked to G11
	i_gmii2rgmii/i_rgmii_rxclk_buf (BUFGCE.I) is locked to BUFGCE_HDIO_X0Y3

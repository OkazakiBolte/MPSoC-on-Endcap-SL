CLKC-3#1 Advisory
Clock Buffer has LOC and not CLOCK_REGION  
The BUFGCE cell i_gmii2rgmii/i_rgmii_rxclk_buf has a LOC constraint, but using the CLOCK_REGION property instead would give more flexibility to the Placer to select the appropriate routing/distribution track.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell Mercury_XU5_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) Mercury_XU5_i/zynq_ultra_ps_e/U0/buffer_pl_clk_1.PL_CLK_1_BUFG and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
